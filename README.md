This repo is to setup a modern IDE for coding in neovim **(Mainly for macOS, if run on windows, needs some modifications ([see here](https://github.com/ye-junzhe/BetterNvim#:~:text=%3CD%2D%3E%20%3D%20Command%20on%20macOS%2C%20and%20it%20only%20works%20in%20neovide%2C%20changes%20needed%20if%20running%20on%20windows)))**

With more than 70 plugins installed

Still developing, so there are many commented out lines for future adjustment

- VSCode-like Auto-completion setup
- Mason for native neovim LSP management
- treesitter for highlighting
- Plugins: bufferline, lualine, nvim-tree, navic, noice, vimspector, todotree ...
- colorscheme : catppuccin
- special setup for Rust development
- **[Neovide](https://neovide.dev/) HIGHLY recommended**
- The `<leader>` key has been changed to `<space>`
